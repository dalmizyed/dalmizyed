# Hi, I'm Kody Almizyed. 
I'm currently an undergraduate student at the **University of Wisconsin-Madison** pursuing a double major in *Mechanical Engineering* and *Computer Science*. I'm interested in the field of <ins>mechatronics</ins>, specifically the bridge between computer science and mechanical engineering, and how it can apply to robotics, aerospace, and automotive design and manufacturing.
